# What is Data Anomaly?

**Data Anomaly** transforms Santiment's massive array of on-chain and social metrics into an automated "**stream of market anomaly events**." When a metric shows a statistically significant deviation in its time series, we don't just alert you to an "anomaly"—we position it as a unified, actionable instrument for **Signal Generation, Risk Management, and Regime Identification**.

- **For Trading**: It filters the "critical few moments" from the noise, serving as a trigger for entries, exits, or watchlist updates.
- **For Risk Management**: It acts as an early warning layer—helping you identify tail risks like crowding, liquidity runs, and sentiment reversals—empowering you to deleverage, reduce exposure, or hedge before the crowd.
- **For Research & Investment Process**: It functions as a **regime-change detector**. When anomalies begin to "cluster" and resonate across multiple metrics, it often signals a fundamental shift in market mechanics, suggesting immediate adjustments to model parameters, factor weights, and risk budgets.

We validate its utility through two rigorous paths: direct **PnL backtesting** and **HAC t-tests** to verify the significance of post-anomaly returns and volatility changes. We are transparent about current productization challenges: the system currently favors "pure detection" over "impact maximization," and it is optimized for daily-frequency, risk, and research scenarios. Our roadmap focuses on evolving social data analysis to upgrade anomalies from isolated data points into **"interpretable events and regime-shift signals"** tailored for active trading and risk control.
